# ATAF Typing Academy Project Report

## Project structure

The app is organized as a static front-end project with:

- root files for the site entry point and configuration
- `assets/` for JavaScript and CSS logic
- `supabase/` for database schema and auth setup SQL
- `docs/` for project notes and reports

## Issues found and fixed

1. Lesson progress sync issue
   - The app saved lesson completions with the correct lesson key, but the restore logic compared against the wrong pattern.
   - Fixed by normalizing stored Supabase lesson keys back to the correct lesson index before marking a lesson complete in the UI.

2. Duplicate sign-out handler
   - Two separate click handlers were attached for the same sign-out button.
   - Removed the duplicate to keep auth behavior in one place.

3. Project hygiene
   - Added a `.gitignore` file so local editor, OS, and environment artifacts are not tracked.

## Current status

- JavaScript syntax check passes.
- Project structure is clean and static-site friendly.
- Supabase-backed lesson persistence and auth flow are in place for a real production setup.

## Next recommended steps

- Configure the Supabase project URL and anon key in `config.js`.
- Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor.
- Enable Email, Google, Microsoft, or Clever auth in Supabase.
- Add the production redirect URL and deploy to Vercel or Netlify.
